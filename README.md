## Database and GraphQL API

Before you begin you will need to have the database and GraphQL API up and running. Visit <https://github.com/fampa/ampa-graphql>

## Fork this repo

`git clone https://github.com/fampa/ampa-pwa.git`

## Set environmental variables

Copy or rename `.env.example` file to `.env`, and `functions/env.json.example` to `functions/env.json`, and fill the variables.

Rename `.firebaserc.example` to `.firebaserc` and change your default firebase project id.

## Prerequisits to be able to deploy to firebase

You'll need to create a Firebase project and enable email and goggle login. You'll also need to enable Firebase Storage to upload files.

You may need to change the Firebase Plan to Blaze to be able to make calls from Firebase Functions to the Hasura database.

Once you have done this, you'll need to:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

## Install the dependencies

```bash
cd functions && yarn && cd .. && yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open another terminal and run the functions in dev mode:

```bash
yarn dev:functions
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
yarn build
```

If you want to deploy to firebase you can directly run

```bash
yarn deploy
```

### Issues

If your firebase functions have permission issues (403 error):

- Go to Google Cloud Console: <https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/?_ga=2.195777388.1777097001.1617712962-377022807.1597671974>
- Click the checkbox next to the function on which you want to grant access.
- Click Show Info Panel in the top right corner to show the Permissions tab.
- Click Add member.
- In the New members field, type `allUsers`.
- Select the role Cloud Functions > Cloud Functions Invoker from the Select a role drop-down menu.
- Click Save.
